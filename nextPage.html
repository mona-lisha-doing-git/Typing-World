        <h1>About Typing</h1>
        <h2>History</h2>
The history of typing spans from early writing machines to modern keyboards. In the 18th and 19th centuries, 
inventors like Henry Mill and Christopher Latham Sholes laid the groundwork with devices that resembled typewriters, 
culminating in the first practical typewriter, the Sholes and Glidden Type-Writer in 1873. The QWERTY keyboard layout, 
invented by Sholes and patented in 1878, became the standard for typewriters and later for computer keyboards, 
influencing the evolution of typing techniques. 

        <h2>Evolution of Keyboards</h2>
The keyboard has evolved from the typewriter's keys used to print text on paper to the diverse range of devices we use today, 
including computers, smartphones, and more. Early keyboards, like those on typewriters, primarily focused on character input, 
while computer keyboards later added special keys for specific functions like Ctrl and Shift. 
The evolution of keyboards has also seen the emergence of various layouts, ergonomic designs, and even virtual keyboards. 

        <h2>Fastest typing speed</h2>
The fastest typing speed ever recorded was 216 words per minute (WPM), achieved by Stella Pajunas-Garnand in 1946 using an IBM electric typewriter. 
This record was set before the advent of computers and modern keyboards
        <h2>Who invented typing?</h2>
The invention of typing is credited to Christopher Latham Sholes, an American inventor, 
who is widely recognized as the "father of the typewriter". 
He developed the first practical typewriter in 1867 and subsequently the QWERTY keyboard, 
which is still the standard layout for computer keyboards today

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <h2>Type your heart out</h2>
Type as much as you want. Never hold back!

        <h2>Mental peace</h2>
Typing, especially in a mindful way, can promote mental peace by fostering focus, reducing stress, 
and allowing for creative expression. The act of typing, particularly when done slowly and deliberately, 
can become a meditative practice, helping to calm the mind and reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed by thoughts. 

        <h2>Satisfying</h2>
Typing can be satisfying due to a combination of physical and psychological factors. The physical act of pressing keys 
provides tactile feedback, which can be engaging and stimulating. The rhythmic and repetitive nature of typing can also be 
calming and stress-relieving for some. Additionally, the ability to express thoughts and ideas quickly and efficiently 
contributes to a sense of accomplishment and productivity. The auditory feedback, especially on mechanical keyboards, 
can also be a source of satisfaction for some.

        <h2>Fun facts about Typing</h2>
-> Typing the English alphabet from A to Z in 3.37 seconds is the world record, 
and the "Backspace" key is the third most used on a typical keyboard.
-> The QWERTY keyboard layout was designed to prevent jamming keys, not to make it difficult to type, 
and the "@" symbol was almost removed from keyboards before being crucial for email.
